# 1. Different Categories of AI

## ðŸ“—NLP (Natural Language Processing)

 NLP is a field of artificial intelligence where it focuses on enabling computers to interpret, generate, and understand human language. Ultimately, it is a path to let computers **speak** and **understand** our language. Chatbot, translators, speech recognition, text summarization, and sentiment analysis AI are classified as NLP.

 Main examples: **GPT**, **BERT**, **T5**

## ðŸ“—CV (Computer Vision)

 CV is a field of artificial intelligence where that enables computers to interpret and understand images in a way that is similar to humans. It involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images and videos to extract meaningful information.

 Main examples: **CNN**, **YOLO**, **VIT(Vision Transformer)**

## ðŸ“— Recommendation Systems

 Includes youtube, shopping mall recommendation engines

 Mainly used tools: **Collaborative filtering(CF)**, **Reinforced learning-based recommendation**, **Deep-learning based recommendation**

 ## ðŸ“— Robotics & Control AI

 Includes Robot Arm Control, Autonomous Driving, and Drone Flight Path Optimization.

 Main examples: **Reinforcement learning(RL)**, **A-star(a pathfinding algorithm)**

 ## ðŸ“— Generative AI

 Includes DALL-E, music generation, code generation.

 Main examples: **GAN**, **Diffusion**, **Transformer**

 ## ðŸ“— Simulation and Game AI

 Includes game NPC AI, chess/go(alphago)

 Main examples: **MCTS**, **RL**

 ## ðŸ“— Finance and Data Analytics AI

 Includes Stock price prediction, fraud detection, credit score evaluation

 Main examples: **Time series analysis (RNN, LSTM), ensemble learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)**

# 2. Elaboration, and different categories of NLP

#### NLP is a field of computer science that enables computers to comprehend, interpret, and generate human language. Essentially, it's how computers "speak" and "understand" our language.
