# Stable Diffusion

## ðŸ“˜ What's Stable Diffusion?

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, generative ai developed by WebUI. It can generate unique, and photorealistic photos from prompts, as well as images.

## ðŸ“˜ How does it work?

#### 1. What is a Prompt?

A prompt is a text description of what you want the AI to generate.
Think of it as giving instructions to a digital artist.

âœ… Example:
a futuristic samurai, standing on a rooftop, cyberpunk city, neon lights, dramatic lighting, 4k, ultra detailed 

#### 2. What is a Negative Prompt?
A negative prompt is what you donâ€™t want to appear in the image.

It tells the AI to avoid certain features or flaws.

âœ… Example:
blurry, low quality, extra fingers, deformed face, bad anatomy, watermark, text

This helps:

- Fix common image problems (bad hands, warped faces)

- Prevent style errors (e.g., anime style when you want realism)
