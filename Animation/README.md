### âœ… The difference of a normal coordinate plane to an animation coordinate plane

A normal coordinate plane is made in such a way where the x and y axis makes a cross.

However, an animation coordinate plane is made in a different way, shown below.

The coordinates also work differently. The further the y axis goes down, it increases. Ex. Coordinate (1,1): 1 left, 1 down

**Frame** : a single still image within a sequence that, when displayed rapidly in succession, creates the illusion of movement.

**FPS(Frames Per Second)** : the number of individual images or frames displayed in a video or animation every second.
